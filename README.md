## Goal: learn better C++ workflow practices
I want to use AoC 2024 to learn about more modern C++ best practices and workflows to improve my own development. This includes using tools such as:

- clang format
- clang tidy (done)
- cppcheck (done)
- sanitizers (done)
- compiler flags (done)
- build modes (partial)
- automated linting, analysis, testing (partial)
- better package management using CPM (done)
