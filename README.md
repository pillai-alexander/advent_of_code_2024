# Advent of Code 2024
Alexander N. Pillai

## Goal: learn better C++ workflow practices
I want to use AoC 2024 to learn about more modern C++ best practices and workflows to improve my own development. This includes using tools such as:

- clang format
- clang tidy
- cppcheck
- sanitizers
- compiler flags
- build modes
- automated linting, analysis, testing
